Three Questions
---

* What is cloud computing? 
* Why should we care? 
* What are we doing about it?

Apologies to HP
---

Having shown that, I need to point out that HP has been very awesome to
Fedora, has engineers that participate in our cloud SIG, and makes the
official Fedora 19 Cloud Image available in their very real public cloud.

The Normal-Person View
---

* Remote storage
* Web-based services
* Marketing, hype, marketing

!

What We're Really Talking About
---
* Computing as a _utility_
* Memory, Cycles, Storage, and Software "as a service"
* Not necessarily on someone else's systems

!

Progress or Pendulum?
---
* 1950s all over again?
* No! Scarcity vs. ubiquity

!

(Okay, so let's get to some definitions)
---

!

National Institute of Standards and Technology
---

* On-demand self-service (no human interaction with providers)
* Broad network access (standards!)
* Resource pooling (dynamic virtual resources)
* Rapid elasticity (the appearance of infinity)
* Measured service (monitor all things)

!

“OSSM”
---

* On-demand 
* Self-service
* Scalable
* Measurable

Also: put an API on it.

!

The Ay-Ay-Esses
---
* IaaS
* PaaS
* SaaS
* Also storage, networking, etc., etc. (<i>X</i>aaS)

!

Where it Lives
---
* Private
* Public
* Community
* Hybrid

!

Okay, so, is this <i>really a thing</i>?
---

!

Here's some numbers
---

In billions:

            2013    2016
    SaaS   $19.8   $32.8
    PaaS    $1.6    $3.0
    IaaS    $9.0   $24.2

    - Gartner

(Perspective: worldwide operating system software market is $32 billion)

Small and Medium Business
---

* Cisco: Half of SMBs currently spend at least 30% of their IT budgets on cloud services
* IBM/ITC: 3 in 10 midsize firms adopting public cloud within 5 years

!

Startups
---

* 83% of US businesses started in the last 3 years said cloud computing made
  it easier to get off the ground
* 20% said they wouldn't have been able to do it at all otherwise

 \- Manchester Business School study (sponsored by Rackspace)

!

And it's Linux
---

* Linux EC2 instances are twice as popular as Windows
* The more powerful the system, the more likely it is to be Linux

 \- Newvem Cloud Radar Report (Oct. 2012)

!

Fedora!
---

* Fedora in the Cloud
* Fedora under the Cloud
* The Cloud for Fedora
* Fedora as a Cloud End-Point

!

Fedora Cloud Image
---

* http://cloud.fedoraproject.org/
* Minimal install + a few utils
* Smaller on-disk than Popular Other Linux
* Launch in EC2 or download `qcow2` or `raw.xz`

!

For F20
---

* Vagrant
* More Visibility
* More Functionality

!

Cloud Services on Fedora
---

* IaaS: OpenStack
* IaaS: Eucalyptus
* PaaS: OpenShift
* SaaS: OwnCloud

!

Nudge, Nudge
---
* OpenNebula
* CloudStack

!

We're Using This
---
* Fedora Infrastructure Cloud
* Development systems
* Testing in EC2

!

Fedora as Cloud End Point
---

* Developer desktop
* Cloud services integration


!

Okay, so...
---

* Cloud is a real thing.
* In fact, it's a big thing.
* Fedora is doing great cloud stuff.
* And we're going to do more.
* Your help wanted!
